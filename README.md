# UI/UX Interview / repo:

## High-Fidelity Wireframe for Active Pauses Mobile-App

In this test, you are expected to create a design solution for a hypothetical company named “AttentiFit”.  You will create a high-fidelity wireframe and a small design system which will include the components used on the test.

## Description

AttentiFit is a non-profit organization that has as a main goal to increase physical activity for all remote workers. They want to design a mobile application where users will receive a notification to remind them to take a break and start doing active pauses like: stand-up, take a small walk inside your house, stretch and other activities. As soon as they get the notification they would have an option to set small amounts of time to complete the task (Ex. If the user is in a rush he can select to take 30 seconds active pause), once the duration is set, the user can choose the category of the active pause and a video will show on screen with the instructions. 

This client requires a visual representation of the notification flow, which is the main activity of this app. A high-fidelity wireframe can work for the client since they have not decided if an application it’s the best choice for this idea.

## Proposed user flow

User gets a push notification to remind him to take the first active pause of the day
User opens the application and sees a pop-up to choose the amount of time he wants to take for the active pause. He the following options: 
30 seconds
1 minute
5 minutes
Once user selects the duration, he will have to choose among the following options to start taking the active pause:
Random
Eyesight
Arms
Legs
Full-Body
When the user selects the category, show a screen where it specifies the category chosen, a small description and a video box that will start showing the exercises.
Once the video is over, a button will be enabled to confirm that the active pause was completed.
When going back to home, offer the user an option to view a calendar where he can check all his activity and the days he has completed with active pauses.

## Points that needs to be considered

User personas’ age is between 22-45 years old.
Color palette has not been decided yet. Build a solution that can adapt to a color palette later.
Frames designed need to be stretchable from the widths, so it can be used with phone and tablet.
